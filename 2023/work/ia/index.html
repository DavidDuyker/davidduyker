            <h1>Industrial Alchemy</h1>
            <h2>
              A small outdoor gear design studio had neglected their digital
              presence and needed a new website to start a new chapter.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Industrial Alchemy works primarily in the outdoor industry as a
              design studio with expertise in full scale production systems.
              Clients range from large scale industry leaders to small specialty
              brands. Industrial Alchemy prides themselves on flexibility and
              successful experience.<br /><br />
              The goal with a new website was to improve the existing client
              acquisition methods as well as open up the opportunity for new
              channels for growth.
            </p>

              src="/old_site/projects/ia/1.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>
              Design<br />Development<br />Implementation<br />Copy and Content
              Editor
            </p>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              During my time working on Industrial Alchemy’s I was also working
              for them as an Industrial Designer. These responsibilities
              separate from the website included a range from patterning to CAD
              modeling and prototyping.
            </p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <h3>Site Audit</h3>
            <img
              srcset="
                /old_site/projects/ia/2@2x.jpg 2x,
                /old_site/projects/ia/2.jpg    1x
              "
              src="/old_site/projects/ia/2.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Existing homepage was a poor introduction to the company. The
              sites neglect made this page so outdated that it undermined the
              authority of the brand. A design focused company needs demonstrate
              their values to potential clients.
            </p>
            <img
              srcset="
                /old_site/projects/ia/3@2x.jpg 2x,
                /old_site/projects/ia/3.jpg    1x
              "
              src="/old_site/projects/ia/3.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Navigating through the site I realized that each page was an
              image. The text was not selectable or editable. This highlighted
              the need for improved SEO for the site as well as a refinement of
              the information presented. The awards and expertise that the
              company prides itself on were hindered by presentation and poor
              design.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              Working with the client to create a product that they feel
              represents and excites them starts with involving their input at a
              foundational level. Initial meetings with the Industrial Alchemy
              leadership involved outlining some basic brand attributes as well
              as goals for the new site. It was apparent from this stage that
              the leadership team had strong impulses that required careful
              guidance.

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <h3>Site Map</h3>
            <img
              srcset="
                /old_site/projects/ia/4@2x.jpg 2x,
                /old_site/projects/ia/4.jpg    1x

              src="/old_site/projects/ia/4.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              <strong>Audit to Site Map</strong><br />I took an overview of the
              original site and retyped out all the useful text. I expected the
              text would be refined later but it was a place to start from
              content wise. From the audit of the existing site, the goals, and
              other assets, I created a site map. The focus was on encouraging
              users to contact Industrial Alchemy and intuitive pathways for
              learning more about the company.
            </p>
            <img
              srcset="
                /old_site/projects/ia/5@2x.jpg 2x,
                /old_site/projects/ia/5.jpg    1x
              "
              src="/old_site/projects/ia/5.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              <strong>Content Development</strong><br />A linked document (based on
              the site map) was the basis for Industrial Alchemy to develop
              their content for each page in an organized way. Industrial
              Alchemy lacked many systems of organization so creating actionable
              and measurable lists and benchmarks was key to the process.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Directions</h3>

              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              <strong>Initial Design Directions</strong><br />Initial designs were
              created based on general expressions of preferences during initial
              meetings. The goal was to further probe the preferences that the
              client was unable to articulate in meetings. These prototypes in
              addition to examining competitors websites was a crucial step in
              both research and design direction.

            <p>
              <strong>Story Focus</strong><br />In order to convey the complex
              history and capabilities of the company I pushed towards a more
              narrative introduction that shows the office space and most
              prominent are the values. Under that there is a brief bit of text
              about who Industrial Alchemy is and what they can do.

              <strong>Action Focus</strong><br />In order to capitalize on this new
              potential channel of client acquisition I wanted to encourage
              action in the user so that ultimately they would look to reach out
              and inquire. This design direction also highlights the products
              with 100% width images and linked product pages.

            <h3>Rapid-Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Git Hub</strong><br />Using a Git-Hub repository I was able to
              create a live prototype to put the final touches on the site
              design and code while the content (copy, images, awards) were
              worked on by the Industrial Alchemy team.
            </p>
            <h3>Copy + content</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Editing</strong><br />The final stretch was defined by copy
              editing and content development. This included organizing image,
              and info databases as well as reviewing copy and aligning it with
              the goals of each section.

            <p>
              The products on the home page are allowed to shine with large 100%
              width images just below the fold. The user is then prompted to see
              more projects. The products page has 12 projects to view.
            </p>

            <p>
              Images and in-depth paragraphs serve as the basis for expressing
              to the user who Industrial Alchemy is. There is a depth to the
              information on the website.
            </p>
            <img
              srcset="
                /old_site/projects/ia/12@2x.jpg 2x,
                /old_site/projects/ia/12.jpg    1x
              "
              src="/old_site/projects/ia/12.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              <strong>inline Navigation</strong><br />The highlight of the narrative
              experience on the site is inline site navigation. User has control
              over where they go but general flow promotes clarity and
              engagement.
            </p>
            <img
              srcset="
                /old_site/projects/ia/13@2x.jpg 2x,
                /old_site/projects/ia/13.jpg    1x
              "
              src="/old_site/projects/ia/13.jpg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              <strong>Menu</strong><br />In supporting the clients voice the menu
              was reduced to a hamburger button. This has obvious usability
              issues but it is a key part of the navigation system and stems
              from client demands.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Copy</strong><br />Industrial Alchemy leadership had strong
              preferences for text heavy pages. This lead to an ever expanding
              opening paragraph and delays on finalization site wide. To
              facilitate this process I worked to copy: slimming down many
              paragraphs and working towards honing the paragraphs to better
              reflect the image of the company.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Image Assets</strong><br />For an image focused website
              careful selection of images is crucial. In order to create
              cohesive product pages and balanced pages I combed archives and
              folders. The final product has high-quality imagery that reflects
              the quality of the products that Industrial Alchemy produces.
